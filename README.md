# frontend-dev-mac-setup

I'm lazy. That's it. Whenever I set up a new mac, I always install the same things, so this is just automating that process for me. It assumes MacOS Catalina, though should work on older versions as well (not tested).

Run ./setup.sh in directory. It will ask you if you want to install a number of apps. If you have permission issues, you may need to run `chmod 744 setup.sh` in directory. 

Have fun!
